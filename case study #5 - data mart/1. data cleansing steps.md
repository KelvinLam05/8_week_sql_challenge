In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

* Convert the week_date to a DATE format

* Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc

* Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column

* Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values

* Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
