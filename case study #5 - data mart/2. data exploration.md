Now let's get percentage of sales for age band and for demographic, excluding unknown values.

**9. Can we use the avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size for each year for Retail vs Shopify? If not - how would you calculate it instead?**

We can not use avg_transaction column to find the average transaction size per year and sales platform. To find the average transaction size we need to calculate the number of transcations per year and sales platform, then the total amount of transactions per year and sales platform. After that we can calculate the average transaction size by dividing the total number of transactions to the total amount of sales.

Here is a query and the result for the correct calculation:

````sql

SELECT
  calendar_year,
  platform,
  ROUND(SUM(sales) :: NUMERIC / SUM(transactions), 2) AS avg_transaction
FROM clean_weekly_sales
GROUP BY
  calendar_year,
  platform
ORDER BY
  calendar_year ASC,
  platform ASC;
````

| 2019          | Shopify  | 183.36          |
| 2020          | Retail   | 36.56           |
| 2020          | Shopify  | 179.03          |
